The player and opponent have a 3x3 grid on their side.
The opponent will roll a 6-sided die and place it on one of the first columns of the grid.
Players gain points for each of the die's corresponding numbers that they have on their grid.
The player will do the same
On the second turn, players can place their roll on the same column as the previous roll or they can place it on a new column.
Every turn after this will be similar with both the opponent and player being able to stack dice on columns or choose a clear column to place the die.
The player WINS when one of the grids is filled and IF their total number is higher than the opponents.
If a player places 2 of the same die together the number that they add to will be doubled.
For example, if a player has 2 dice on a column and each of them has a 2 value players will add those values which makes it 4 then multiply it by 2 which would make it 8.
If a player places 3 of the same die together the number that they add to will be tripled.
For example, if a player has 3 dice on a column and each of them has a 2 value players will add those values which makes it 6 then multiply it by 3 which would make it 18.
Players can negate a die or dice on an opponent's side if the player gets the same number and places it on the column that parallels their opponent's column.
For example, if an opponent rolls a 6 and places it then the player rolls a 6 and places it on the column paralleling where the opponent placed their 6 then the 6 on the opponent's side will disappear while the player will keep their 6.
This will erase all of the corresponding numbers from the opponent's side. So, if the opponent has three 6's in one column and that player puts a 6 on its parallel the 6's will all be erased on the opponent's paralleled column.
